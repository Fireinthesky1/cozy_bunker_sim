[ ] resizable window glitching

NOTES:
 - I want the game engine as decoupled as possible from SDL. This way I
   can reuse the engine for later projects and not have to rewrite the engine

 - We will use a polling implementation and poll inputs at the beggining of each game loop
   cycle

 - How will we retrieve inputs?
   - SDL
 - How will we process inputs?
   - event sytem ( I want to run this game single threaded )
