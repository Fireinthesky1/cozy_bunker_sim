* Purpose of the EMS
User input can come into the game unpredictably. Rather than busy-waiting for
input to come in we want to implement an [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_pattern][observer pattern]]. Our implementation
will be asynchronous. I.E. The time that the event is registered is temporally
decoupled from the time the event is processed. For this decoupling we utilize
an event queue.
