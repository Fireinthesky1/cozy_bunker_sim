How do we get user input?
    - SDL hardware events tell us what button was pressed / joystick was pressed
How do we perform work on this input?
    - we feed these inputs into a queue which feeds a finite state machine to decide
      what the character does
How is the player movement modeled?
    - a finite state machine
