The Problem we want to solve:
    - We want to decouple the recieving of user input from the time that the user
      input is processed. So that we can asynchronously receive player input
      and deal with player input in chunks when we need to.
    - No blocking to get input ever

Architecture
 1) get all hardware events and process most critical events
    - CRITICAL EVENTS: quitting the game
 2) as we get those events place them in the event queue
 3) every call to update will process all of the events
